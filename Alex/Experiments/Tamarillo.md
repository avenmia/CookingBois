# Tamarillo

I found these at a Portugese / Brazillian grocery store chain. They were being sold as "Tree Tomatoes" 

## Notes
---
### Tasting
* Skin is apple like but less waxy and thinner. 
* The pith is bitter and I should consider that when I make dishes with this in the future. 
* The insides smell and taste like a cross between a passionfruit and a tomato. 
* Tastes acidic, meaty and slightly sweet and salty. It's probably high in glutamates and I would compare it to a meatier tomato. Delicious. 
### Cooking
* I cooked two of them down to a jammy consistency with a table spoon or two of olive oil and 1/4 cup of water for a "tomato" sauce and a pinch of salt. 
* It seems to have lost some of the meaty taste while cooking. Perhaps some of the glutamates were broken down in the cooking process. 
* I think this would have been tastier as a cold tomato sauce / in a gazpacho. 
* The bitter taste actually seems to have been enhanced by the cooking as well as acidity. 
### Improvements
* Next time, I should just use the meatier pulp / insides in order to avoid the bitter pith.
* Avoid cooking this to preserve its meatiness?
